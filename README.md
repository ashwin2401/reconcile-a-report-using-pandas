### Project Overview

 This mini project get me through more addon function which was earlier in c,c++ but apart from palindrome,fibonacci there were some more function like k-distinct,compression and scramble which helps me to learn more additive functionalities.


### Learnings from the project

 Again the same function creation but different operation approaches like getting a distinct character or number via k-distinct , compressing strings with concatinating indexing to it and scrambling the words,character and a complete string which states that the inputed string is present in another string with checking of each caracter present in the string.
